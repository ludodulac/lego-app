"""Capability registry separating known LEGO parts from engine-approved placement.

The processed piece dataset is intentionally richer than the deterministic M0
engine. A part being present in that dataset must never make it eligible for
automatic placement by itself. This module gives downstream optimizers an
explicit staged contract and can audit a generated BrickModel before export.
